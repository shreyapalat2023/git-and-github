            <li>Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Github is an online platform that allows you
                to store and share your code with others. It is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on
                projects and to share code. It is not that Github is the only provider of Git repositories, but it is
                one of the most popular ones.</li>
